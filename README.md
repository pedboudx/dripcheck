dripcheck is a web app I made using express.js to help me better learn how express and API calls work.

How it works:
1. User enters their city
2. weather information about their city is obtained via an openweathermap api call
3. The weather information is then sent in an openai api call attached to the question 'what should i wear?'
4. openai returns a response which is displayed on the user's screen
